# Fasteners

## Bearings

4mm ID, 4mm depth, 9mm OD

Instead of paying $5 each (x24), I found some on aliexpress

Bearings seem of reasonable quality, centre retainer is slightly looser than I'd like.

## Shoulder bolts

There are two shoulder lengths required, 4mm for effector and bicep connections, and 8mm for use with the clevis links.

I went with the cost effective aliexpress option https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10pcs-M3-thread-4mm-stainless-steel-304-shoulder-screw/32861370400.html

4mm and 8mm skews were purchased.  
They seem dimensionally undersized for the shoulder diameter (3.85-3.92mm shoulder).  
Hex head forming seems a bit rough.   
Otherwise seem ok though.
