# Version 1 Fasteners

## Bearings

4mm ID, 4mm depth, 9mm OD

Instead of paying $5 each (x24), I found some on aliexpress

https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-10-PCS-S684ZZ-Bearings-4x9x4-mm-Stainless-Steel-Ball-Bearings-DDL-940ZZ/32835314182.html

Bearings seem of reasonable quality, centre retainer is slightly looser than I'd like.

## Shoulder bolts

There are two shoulder lengths required, 4mm for effector and bicep connections, and 8mm for use with the clevis links.

I went with the cost effective aliexpress option https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10pcs-M3-thread-4mm-stainless-steel-304-shoulder-screw/32861370400.html

4mm and 8mm skews were purchased.  
They seem dimensionally undersized for the shoulder diameter (3.85-3.92mm shoulder).  
Hex head forming seems a bit rough.   
Otherwise seem ok though.

# Version 2 Mechanism

The version 1 mechanism has way too much slop due to poor tolerances in the bearings and shoulder bolts. Good lesson in not trusting Aliexpress fasteners...

This set will use higher quality fasteners from Misumi, but requires a few parts to be reprinted.

## Bearing Retaining Posts

Without re-machining or redesigning the elbow spacer part, I'm limited to a M3 thread.

The "Bearing Shaft Screws with Retaining Rings - Flanged" look pretty good, https://sg.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300115260/
or a simpler option that don't have a retainer (basically a shoulder bolt) https://sg.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110302644720/

The M3 thread size in these categories locks us into a 5mm diameter which drives bearing selection.
Its got a 6mm thread length, and 8mm head


## Bearings

Inner Diameter: 5mm
Outer Diameter:	11mm
Width:			5mm

The misumi branded stainless steel shielded bearings https://sg.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110302273360/?HissuCode=SB685ZZ look like a good option. Its 3.60USD at qty 26 (need 24 + 2 spares) 

94.64USD.

## Clevis Bearing Pin/Shaft

TBD, misumi have poor selection of ~10mm options, most start at 15mm shank which isn't ideal.
